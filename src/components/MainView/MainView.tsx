        <h1>Hi there!</h1>
        <p>This website is for people who like Movies, and are willing to play a little game to find out, which movie do they like the most.</p>
        <h3>The mechanizm in Movie Wars is simple.</h3>
        <p>First choose how many movies do you want to compare.</p>
        <p>Than wi will show you pairs of movie. Your job is to choose between them. Which one is better.</p>
        <p>You will be having almost two times more battles, than movies, so choose carefully.</p>
        <p>The app is created mainly for computers. It might be working on phones, but looks much worse.</p>
        <h4>Our goal is to choose the best one.</h4>
        <em> Remember, that you don't know all movies, and the more movies you will the greater chance to not know the movie.</em>
        <h3>Godspeed, and have fun with movies!</h3>
