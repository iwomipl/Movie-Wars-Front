        <h1>Hi there!</h1>
        <p>This website is for people who like Movies and are willing to play a little game to find out, which movie they like the most.</p>
        <h3>The mechanism in Movie Wars is very simple.</h3>
        <p>First choose how many movies you want to compare.</p>
        <p>Than I will show you pairs of movies. Your job is to choose between them. Which one is better for You.</p>
        <p>You will be having almost two times more battles, than movies, so choose number of movies carefully.</p>
        <h4>Our goal is to find out which one is the best one for You.</h4>
        <em>Remember, that you don't know all movies and the more movies you will try to compare, the greater the chance to not know the movie.</em>
        <h3>Godspeed and have fun with movies!</h3>
